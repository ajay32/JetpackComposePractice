// Concept - Constraint Layout

//"Flat view hierarchies" is a term used in UI development, particularly in the context of Android and web development,
//to describe a layout structure where the depth of the view tree is minimized. In a flat hierarchy,
//views are arranged with as few nested layers as possible. This concept is important for several reasons:

// advantage -- memory usage effectient, fast rendering, simpler layout, reduce overlapping of elements

//=============================================================

// benifits of Jetpack compose over traditional view system
// Simplicity, Readability, Efficiency (less biolerplate code), Simplified Codebase,
// Reactive UI Updates (better state management)
// Flat View Hierarchies
// Interoperability - can use with xml layouts
// Integration with Existing Architecture
// Preview Annotations
//Single Source of Truth: It encourages unidirectional data flow and state ownership,



//=========================
// Single source of truth concept

//lets take example we have two data sources  Rest API + Database Cache ----> Mobile app ( here data is updating in the mobile app from two differnt sources
// SSoT ->   Rest API -> Database Cachce -> Android app ( only database cache is responsible for data)
